# Overview 

In this course, I enhanced my skills in using the Django framework to:

- Set up a Django project and application using the command-line tools.
- Create models to structure and store data with the integrated ORM.
- Create views to handle user requests.
- Use templates to separate the presentation layer from the logic and render dynamic contents.
- Use migrations tools and fix merging conflicts.
- Manage data with CRUD operations through the Django admin interface.
- Build a custom CRUD interface using Forms and ModelForms.
